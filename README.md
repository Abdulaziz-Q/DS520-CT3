# DS520-CT3
Critical Thinking Assignment 3 is part of DS520 (Big Data Processing &amp; Analytics) course

### CT3: MongoDB Database 

In this critical thinking, we will do tasks on MongoDB. The first task is creating a collection of five columns and ten rows. The second task is writing No-SQL queries to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) rows to this collection. The IDE that we will use to do the previous tasks is the MongoDB compass.
